transactions.\nPreparing the Application\nThis is an Angular 8 project using grunt as the build system, SASS for CSS, and Bootstrap for layout. npm is the package manager. \nAssuming you already have node installed via brew install node or similar, begin by running the following commands in the terminal:\ngit clone https://github.com/HII-C/patient_viewer.git\ncd patient_viewer\nnpm install -g grunt\nnpm install # to install project development dependenciesIf you do not have npm installed, do the following:\n\nMac: brew install node in Terminal\nWindows: Instructions\nLinux: Instructions\n\nThe project was tested specifically with node version 10.19.0.\nRunning the Application\nTo launch in development mode, run the following terminal command from the patient_viewer folder:\ngrunt --force # to serve the project and automatically recompile on file changesThen, do the following:\n\nVisit HSPC Sandbox, select the \"HII-C\" sandbox, choose the \"Apps\" option from the left menu, click on the \"HII-C Confidential [USE THIS]\" app, and then click \"Launch\". \nSelect the persona \"John Smith\", and patient Adams, Daniel X in the popup. This should open the Patient Viewer application.\nOnce you are done running Patient Viewer, make sure to terminate the grunt --force command in the terminal.\n\nDevelopment Guidelines\nDo's:\n\nPrefer to use let rather than var for declaring variables. The scoping for variables declared with var is unintuitive and can result in strange bugs.\nPrefer to create models (such as Encounter) rather than dealing with JSON directly. By doing so, we can take advantage of Typescript's type checking and code completion.\n\nDont's:\n\nAvoid using libraries like jQuery. Also avoid using any other approach to accessing the DOM directly (ie, document.getElementById(..)).\nAvoid leaving console.log(..) statements in the code when pushing to the repository. You can use them while developing locally but it can cause clutter in the repository.\nWrite a brief comment above each component and method that you write giving a brief overview of the functionality. If some code is particularly complex, place comments within the body of the method too.\nAvoid writing components that are very similar to one another. Instead, create a generic component that supports all use cases through an interface (examples are contextMenu.component.ts and hoverBox.component.ts).\n\nLicense\nApache
