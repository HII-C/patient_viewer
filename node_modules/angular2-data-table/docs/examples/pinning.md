# Column Pinning

Below is a example of using left and right column freezing. This allows you to
static position columns while maintaining scrollbar horizontally for interior
columns.

## Important Notes
The columns that are going to be pinned to the left or right
must be in those respective positions. Example: You can't pin a column
to the left that is the last row on the right.
